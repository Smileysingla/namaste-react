      screen, then it loads react and react dom into our code then it loads
      App.js into our code then it execute App.js code line by line. -->

    <!-- This is useful for DOM operation -->
    <!-- Can't we club these two file into one? -->
    <!-- No we can't club both files into one  because React just not only works on browser, we have React Native also.
        so first file is like a core react thing,
        but,this file is like a bridge between these react and browsers  
    -->
    <script
      crossorigin
      src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"
    ></script>

    <script src="./App.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
<!-- 
Will the order of this file matter ? if I place     <script src="./App.js" ></script> before cdn link what will happen?


It will through an error, saying React is not defined
